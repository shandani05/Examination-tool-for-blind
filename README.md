# Examination-tool-for-blind        

Online examination is one such method
which plays a major part in recent days. However, blind or visually impaired people
generally cannot attend those exams on their own, without anyone else&#39;s help. Currently,
blind persons take tests using braille or with the assistance of a writer who performs on
their behalf. Additionally, scribes are required to produce a variety of different documents.
Many people are reluctant to apply as scribes because of this involved process. The
proposed work is based on Speech Synthesis (text-to-speech conversion) for dictating
questions to the blind candidate. Speech-to-text conversion could be used to record their
response and this process is implemented in our project. When several visually impaired
students write the exam at the same time, it causes a lot of noise and disruption for the
other students. Hence Sign language is also used as a medium of response. MediaPipe is a
cross-platform library that offers fantastic ready-to-use machine learning solutions for
computer vision problems.
